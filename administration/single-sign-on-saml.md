# Managing Users

### Overview

Team members can create Trunk accounts with either GitHub or Google. We highly suggest you use the Google approach, because sometimes GitHub accounts are not associated with the company email, and once created they cannot be added to your Trunk org even if they later update GitHub with their work email address. A much better option is to use your company's Google account associated with your work email.

### Initial Setup Steps

* Log in to [app.trunk.io](https://app.trunk.io/) with a Google account associated with the domain for your company,
* Create a Trunk org
* Add your company domain to the Trunk org under Settings -> Team Members -> Team Domains.

* Have the rest of your users log in with their company email accounts as well

Trunk does not support SAML at this time. If you are interested in SAML support please contact sales@trunk.io.
