## Feature Requests

We're just getting started building what you need to land code faster. If there's something you want us to build, whether it's that one magical feature you really, _really_ want, or a linter that we haven't gotten to yet, just drop us a line! You can add a feature request on our [feature Board](https://features.trunk.io), or reach out on the [Trunk community slack](https://slack.trunk.io/), [email us](mailto:support@trunk.io), tweet [@trunkio](https://twitter.com/trunkio), or [carrier pigeon](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1149).
