# Uploader

Trunk Flaky Tests detects and tracks flaky tests in your repos by receiving uploads from your test runs in CI. Trunk Flaky Tests takes the [JUnit XML format](https://github.com/testmoapp/junitxml) for uploads. These uploads happen in the CI jobs used to run tests in your nightly CI, post-commit jobs, and your PR checks.

If you're setting up Trunk Flaky Tests for the first time, you can follow the guides for your CI provider and test framework.

### Installing the CLI

The CLI should be downloaded as part of your test workflow in your CI system. The details vary by [CI Provider](ci-providers/), but generally should be downloaded directly from the analytics-cli release page using curl like this:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Linux x86_64" %}
```bash
curl -fsSL --retry 3 \
  "https://github.com/trunk-io/analytics-cli/releases/latest/download/trunk-analytics-cli-x86_64-unknown-linux.tar.gz" \
  | tar -xvz > ./trunk-analytics-cli
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Linux arm64" %}
```bash
curl -fsSL --retry 3 \
    "https://github.com/trunk-io/analytics-cli/releases/latest/download/trunk-analytics-cli-aarch64-unknown-linux.tar.gz" \
    | tar -xvz > ./trunk-analytics-cli
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="macOS x86_64" %}
```bash
curl -fsSL --retry 3 \
    "https://github.com/trunk-io/analytics-cli/releases/latest/download/trunk-analytics-cli-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.gz" \
    | tar -xvz > ./trunk-analytics-cli
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="macOS arm64" %}
```bash
curl -fsSL --retry 3 \
    "https://github.com/trunk-io/analytics-cli/releases/latest/download/trunk-analytics-cli-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz" \
    | tar -xvz > ./trunk-analytics-cli
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

{% hint style="info" %}
The `trunk-analytics-cli`
{% endhint %}

and then invoked like this. The `trunk-analytics-cli` binary will already be marked executable.

```
./trunk-analytics-cli upload --junit-paths "test_output.xml" \
   --org-url-slug <TRUNK_ORG_SLUG> \
   --token $TRUNK_API_TOKEN
```

### Uploading from the CLI

{% hint style="info" %}
The uploaded tests are processed by Trunk periodically on a schedule and not in real-time. Wait for at least an hour after the initial upload before theyâ€™re accurately displayed in Trunk. Multiple uploads are required before a test can be accurately detected as broken or flaky.
{% endhint %}

Trunk provides the `trunk-analytics-cli` command-line tool to upload and analyze test results.

Run the command line with one of the following commands

| Command  | Description                                          |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `test`   | Test the upload process, but do not upload any data. |
| `upload` | Upload data to Trunk Flaky Tests                     |
| `help`   | Print the help message                               |

The `upload` command uses the following arguments

| Argument                                            | Description                                                                                 |

## Troubleshooting

As a general rule you should download the release on every CI run. **Do not bake the CLI into a container or VM.** This ensures your CI runs are always using the latest build.

The `trunk-analytics-cli` binary should be run from the repository root. If you need to run the binary from another location, you must provide the path to the repo root using the `--repo-root`argument. The `--junit-paths` argument accepts the xml file locations as both a list of globs or absolute paths.

### Organization not found

If you receive an error that the org slug or API token is not found, double check that the secrets stored in your CI provider are the same as the Organization settings by navigating to **Settings** -> **Manage** -> **Organization** on [app.trunk.io](http://app.trunk.io).

Make sure you are getting your _Organization Slug_, not the Organization Name.

Also make sure you are getting your O\_rganization API Token\_, _**not your project/repo token**_.
