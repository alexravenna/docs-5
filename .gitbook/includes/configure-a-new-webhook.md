## Configure a New Webhook

To integrate with a third-party service such as Slack or GitHub Issues, you need to configure webhooks to send requests to their APIs. In the **Endpoints** tab, you can configure sending webhooks to a predetermined endpoint by clicking the **Add Endpoint** button. You can find docs about adding endpoints from [the Svix docs](https://docs.svix.com/receiving/using-app-portal/adding-endpoints).
