## Verifying Webhooks

If you're building custom apps to receive webhooks sent from Trunk, you should verify Webhooks to prevent malicious attacks from impersonation.&#x20;

Svix provides a library in order to allow easy verification of these webhook signatures. Docs on how to set this up can be found [here](https://docs.svix.com/receiving/verifying-payloads/how). If you wish to verify webhooks manually instead, you can find Svix docs on how to do that [here](https://docs.svix.com/receiving/verifying-payloads/how-manual).
